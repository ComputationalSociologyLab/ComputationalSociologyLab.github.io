### Changes in the labor market and higher education in the digital transformation era   
_2023.5-2023.10_   
In this project, we study how the labor market and higher education have been changing in the middle of the digital transformation era. From the results, we find three main implications: 1) different countries adopt different strategies to maintain their competency in response to digital transformation. 2) White collars will not be simply replaced by generative AI. They already started to find a strategy to survive with generative AI tech by voluntarily educating themselves. 3) Higher education has been steering its focus to synchronize itself with high-resource fields, medicine and computer science. We are currently working on to publish these results in academic journals. #genAI_inequality #higher_ed_move

### Remote work and gender in higher education   
_2023.1-2023.10_   
We study how women scholars in higher education re-organize their work and balance domestic labor in the remote work environment. Our results show that women scholars favor remote work as a way to take care of their family members, particularly young children. However, this strategy extends womenâ€™s general working hours and blurs the boundary between private and public spheres, which ends up draining their mental energy and productivity.
