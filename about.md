### About us
We are a group of data scientists interested in broadly-defined social science topics nested in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Using big data and computational techniques, we explore innovative ways of investigating old and new social problems. Our lab’s agenda is not static but rather the results of collective interests of lab members. Currently, our lab members’ research topics center around fairness/ethics in AI, law and society, knowledge communication, and organization diversity.

### Research
Society, like human beings, is full of complexity and irregularity, which makes social scientists difficult to investigate the world. Owing to the advancement of big data, we have one more clue to observe fine-grained human behavior through this lens. Our lab maximizes this opportunity by collecting and analyzing big data that were not for academic purposes before. By doing so, we not only expand the understanding of society, but also show the direction toward fair and just society. 
We take an interdisciplinary approach covering a wide range of topics. Simultaneously, we connect theoretically engaging academic research with practically useful industry and government research. We’ve pursued projects that involve diversity in organization, technology and society, law and society, and global knowledge structure.
We illustrate the detailed list of current projects and working papers in this lab page. Please check out the latest works of lab members in [projects](https://thecomputationalsociologylab.github.io/project/) and [publications](https://thecomputationalsociologylab.github.io/publication/) tab.

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is surprisingly diverse. Our interests span sociology, computer science, information science, law, public policy, international relations, economics, and many other disciplines. We are mostly master’s students and undergrad interns at this moment. Visit our [people page](https://thecomputationalsociologylab.github.io/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab.

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Weekly 'lab teachings' where someone teaches a thing. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. 'One-on-ones'. Every semester everyone in the lab is expected to sit down with everyone else for an hour.
0. Lab tea time. It's tea! And science. A 10-minute talk by someone about anything, including their current work.
0. Coding overviews. Structured like the one-on-ones
0. A lab hammock, hangboard, and art on loan from the Penn Museum
0. Monday morning donuts @ 9:00am

Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things.
