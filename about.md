### About us
We are a group of data scientists interested in broadly-defined social science topics nested in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Using big data and computational techniques, we explore innovative ways of investigating old and new social problems. Our lab’s agenda is not static but rather the results of collective interests of lab members. Currently, our lab members’ research topics center around fairness/ethics in AI, law and society, knowledge communication, and organization diversity.

### Research
Society, like human beings, is full of complexity and irregularity, which makes social scientists difficult to investigate the world. Owing to the advancement of big data, we have one more clue to observe fine-grained human behavior through this lens. Our lab maximizes this opportunity by collecting and analyzing big data that were not for academic purposes before. By doing so, we not only expand the understanding of society, but also show the direction toward fair and just society. 
We take an interdisciplinary approach covering a wide range of topics. Simultaneously, we connect theoretically engaging academic research with practically useful industry and government research. We’ve pursued projects that involve diversity in organization, technology and society, law and society, and global knowledge structure.
We illustrate the detailed list of current projects and working papers in this lab page. Please check out the latest works of lab members in [projects](https://computationalsociologylab.github.io/project/) and [publications](https://computationalsociologylab.github.io/publication/) tab.

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is surprisingly diverse. Our interests span sociology, computer science, information science, law, public policy, international relations, economics, and many other disciplines. We are mostly master’s students and undergrad interns at this moment. Visit our [people page](https://computationalsociologylab.github.io/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab.

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a great spot for anyone who wants to lead their own projects with an open-mind set. Instead of having one big lab project, each person in the lab leads their own individual project and collaborates when needed. 
While we change spontaneously, in general, we have one weekly lab meeting every Friday where we discuss each lab member’s research progress and scientific writing techniques. We sometimes hang out for something fun such as the annual KAIST strawberry party.
