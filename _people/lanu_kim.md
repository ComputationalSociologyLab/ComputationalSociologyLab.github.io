Lanu Kim runs her lab at KAIST. She feels proud of herself running one of the few social science labs in the middle of science and technology university. She is interested in understanding academic knowledge creation by mainly examining the impact of academic search engines, gender inequality in higher education, and the social structure of knowledge construction. She is enjoying expanding her interests toward topics such as law and society or fairness in AI, owing to the diverse contribution from lab members. She was trained as a sociologist and got her PhD degree in the University of Washington, then moved to Stanford university for her postdoctoral training. Currently, she holds multiple affiliations at KAIST including the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences, Graduate School of Data Science, and School of Computing.
