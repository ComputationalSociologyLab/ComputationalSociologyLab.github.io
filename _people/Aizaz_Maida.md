## About Me
Hello! I am a masters student at the Graduate School of Data Science (GSDS), after having finished my undergraduate degree in Industrial Design with a minor in AI, also at KAIST. I was born in Pakistan and raised in Saudi Arabia, and enjoy finding intersections between design, data and AI. In my free time, I like to gym, read, travel and hang out with cats.
 

## My interests
* Computational social science
* Data-centric design
* Science of science
